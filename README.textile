h1. builder.js

p. An example of metalinguistic abstraction in JavaScript.

p. Firefox allows you to implement a method called `__noSuchMethod__`
that will allow you to intercept calls to un-implemented methods on
that object.

p. Hopefully this will help motivate the ECMAScript committee to
add `__noSuchMethod__` or some other support for flexible dispatch to
the standard. This is well tread ground.

p. Inspired by "Ruby's Builder":http://builder.rubyforge.org/ and "Io's Builder.":http://web.archive.org/web/20080430135919/hackety.org/2008/01/10/lazyBricksLazyMortar.html
